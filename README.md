# Dining Hall Analysis - Pilot Study
Exploratory analysis into the Claremont Colleges dining halls. 
January 2, 2017

## Background
Students at the Claremont Colleges have the option of attending seven different dining halls on campus. Each school has its own dining hall(s) and dining hall service. Students enter the dining hall by "swiping" in to the meal using their ID card. The Claremont Colleges Consortium keeps track and stores each students meal swipes and every individual has access to their last six months of data. I find the enviornment of the dining halls an interesting point of study. The data could provide insight into ways to reduce food waste and operation costs at the dining halls, as well as overall trends within the student body. Although the Consortium could not give me access to their anonymized records because of privacy concerns, I decided to begin my own study on my own records. 

First I will look at my own records and create graphs to help understand the data and further my questions. After this I will collect more data from my friends. I will figure out a process of anonymizing the data from my friends. If looking at my friends data proves fruitful I will expand my project to a randomized sample of all students at the Claremont Colleges. Another goal I have next semester is use an Arduino and machine vision to count dirty plates/amount of food waste on each plate as they move on the dirty dish conveyor belt.

Here are some of the initial questions I am interested in:

Every meal, the dining hall managers must decide how much food to make and how many workers to have on hand. Overestimating the demand of the meal can be costly to the enviornment and to the dining hall. The managaer at the Pomona dining told me she has her own method of predicting food waste. Can the data be used to create a better prediction for when and how many people will be at each meal? I will start by looking at can the data be used to predict when and where individual students will go to a meal? It would be interesting to tie in the publically released menus to the explanatory variables, as well as weather and posibily even class schedule, to see if these factors change individual's decisions. Perhaps students could be rewarded on an app by stating where they will go to a meal in the future. If they go to the predetermined meal they could be rewarded, and if they don't they could have points deducted. 

The dining halls both compete and colloborate. At the end of each semester, the Consortium calculates the net import and export of students at each dining hall and then money is redistributed. For example, if Pitzer college has 10 more Pomona students eat at its dining hall than Pitzer has eat at Pomona's dining hall, then Pitzer will pay back Pomona. I am interested in analyzing when students eat at different campuses.

Often groups of friends, class mates, or teammates will eat meals together. If two individuals swipe in to the dining at a similar time, perhaps they are friends. I will look at the dining hall data to see how often two individuals enter a dining hall together, which may  provide insight into if they are friends and then if they are more likely to attend meals together in the future. 

I am interested in the general statistics of when and where individuals eat. Are there trends? Do students go to meals later or less frequently in the end of the semester? Is my personal schedule predictable?
